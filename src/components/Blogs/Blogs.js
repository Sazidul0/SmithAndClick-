            <h2 className=''>1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?</h2>
            <div className='ms-3'>
                <p className='mb-0'><b>Authentication:</b></p>
                <p>Authentication verifies who the user is. <br />
                    Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user. <br />
                    Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process. <br />
                    Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user. <br />
                </p>
                <p className='mb-0'><b>Authorization:</b></p>
                <p>Authorization determines what resources a user can access. <br />
                    Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization. <br />
                    Authorization always takes place after authentication. <br />
                    Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.
